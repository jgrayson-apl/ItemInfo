### Concept
 This is just a *demo*, used to show how some of our APIs can be used to provide additional functionality.

### Workflow
  1. Select items based on folder, tags, group, or search.
  2. Filter based on item title and type.
  3. Display items in different ways by selecting one of the 'Views'.
  3. Use ‘Tag Editor’ to Add, Replace, or Remove multiple tags from multiple items.
  4. Use 'Register Services' to add ArcGIS Server services as new items.
